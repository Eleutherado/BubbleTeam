# Status: building MVP

It is just the extension example given by the google [tutorial](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted). Test it like  [this](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)



## Done
* Added a description
* Added an icon (from google's material icons) -- probably need a better one

## To Do
### Programming
* Verify valid ID
* Scrape URLS
* Create Viz page (link to real website) + info like "we are doing this, go on with your day check back in to see results"
* 24 hours after creation, show post survey + notify
* Enable extension to store URL of a site (POSTing it to a server?)
* Enable extension to detect when user lands on a URL who's root is whitelisted as a news source of interest
* Enable extension to keep track of how long a user spends on a tracked page.
* Link to Pre-survey and to Post-survey (Google Forms)
* Give Users a Unique Identifier for data analysis purpose
* Somehow allow users to visualize their news consumption so far.

### No programming
* Create a News Source list taking into account _readability_ and _popularity_
* Create a Pre and Post Likert scale survey to see if visualizing news consumption habits had any effect on perception/awareness or even behavior (in Google Forms)
* Come up with a way to allow users visualize their tracked news consumption so far.
